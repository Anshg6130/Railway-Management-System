# IRCTC Railway Management System

## Problem Statement
Hey there, Mr. X. You have been appointed to design a railway management system like IRCTC, where users can come on the platform and
check if there are any trains available between 2 stations.
The app will also display how many seats are available between any 2 stations and the user can book a seat if the availability > 0 after
logging in. Since this has to be real-time and multiple users can book seats simultaneously, your code must be optimized enough to handle
large traffic and should not fail while doing any bookings.
If more than 1 users simultaneously try to book seats, only either one of the users should be able to book. Handle such race conditions
while booking.

---
This Railway Management System simulates key features of the IRCTC platform. It allows users to check train availability, book seats, and update train details while ensuring role-based access for both users and admins. The backend is built with Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL.

## Features

- User registration and login
- JWT-based authentication for secure access
- Check available trains between source and destination
- Book train seats with race condition handling
- Admin functionalities: add new trains, update seat availability, etc.
- Role-based access (admin/user)
- Error handling and input validation

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v14 or later)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) (Database setup)
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) (for API testing)

### Environment Variables

You need to create a `.env` file in the root of your project with the following environment variables:

``` bash
PORT=3000
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=Ansh@123
DB_NAME=irctc_db
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
API_KEY=ansh_g
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anshg6130/IRCTC_API_WorkIndia.git
   cd irctc-railway-management
   ```
   
2. Install all necessary dependencies using npm:
   
   ```bash
    npm install 
   ```
4. Set up your MySQL database:
  * Create a MySQL database named irctc_db.
  * Run the SQL scripts in database/schema.sql to create necessary tables (users, trains, bookings).

 Example:
 ``` bash
 CREATE DATABASE irctc_database;
USE irctc_database;

CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    role ENUM('user', 'admin') DEFAULT 'user',
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE trains (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    train_number VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    source VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    destination VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    total_seats INT NOT NULL,
    available_seats INT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE bookings (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    train_id INT,
    seats INT NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (train_id) REFERENCES trains(id)
);
```

### Starting the Server
Once the setup is complete, start the server using npm:

```bash
npm start

```
#### Note :- By default, the server will run on port 3000. You can access the API at http://localhost:3000.

### Running Tests

You can test all the available APIs using Postman. The endpoints are well-structured and follow RESTful conventions.

```bash
[
  {
    "trainNumber": "123123",
    "source": "Ranchi",
    "destination": "Delhi",
    "totalSeats": 300
  },
  {
    "trainNumber": "124124",
    "source": "Ranchi",
    "destination": "Delhi",
    "totalSeats": 350
  },
  {
    "trainNumber": "125125",
    "source": "Ranchi",
